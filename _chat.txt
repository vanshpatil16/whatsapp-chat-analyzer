The aptitude test will be on 8th October, 2024 (Tuesday) at D. J. Sanghvi at 1 P.M. (exact place is to be decided).
The test will have questions on English Comprehension, Logical Reasoning, Pattern Recognition, Analytical Thinking, Data Analysis, etc. 

If interested, fill this form: https://forms.gle/AJnLtMU55KWmkqL97 (Please do not lie about anything. Selection for the team will be purely based on your score in the aptitude test).

[11/10/24, 7:58:47 PM] ~ airenavishi: *Important announcement*

Nobody I repeat nobody will buy that Wipro ka internship vala thing.

 *It's a fucking scam* , koi bhi company mai paisa deke internship ke liye nhi jaana hota hai. *Internship ke liye paisa nhi lagta hai* it's something you get purely on the basis of your skills , so agar you get a message on your DM regarding payment, *don't pay*

Thank you 
Love y'all 🫶

[11/11/24, 11:37:26 PM] ~ Neil Mhatre: Working: The sample to be analysed is taken in a sample container. The burner is the source of
flame which is produced by burning of fuel, such as acetylene or natural gas or propane-butane gas, in the
presence of air or oxygen. The sample is sucked up by air and is passed into the nebulizer. Nebulizer or
aspirator is a device that introduces the sample solution in the flame at the balanced rate. The gases help in
aspiration and making the mist of the sample, called aerosol.
 The temperature of about 2000-3000°C is obtained due to which excitation of valence electron/s
takes place. The molecules and ions of the sample get decomposed and reduced to give atoms. The
characteristic wavelength of the light is emitted. The emitted wavelength is selected by the monochromator.
In some cases, optical filters are also used to select the emission wavelength. The emitted light is allowed to
fall on the detector. The detector is photomultiplier detector, which produces an electric signal proportional
to the intensity of emitted light.

[12/12/24, 9:06:27 AM] ~ Sakshi Gandhi: InnovateX is a Technology and Software Solutions firm located in Bangalore. It specializes in AI-driven productivity tools and SaaS platforms for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with a mission to empower SMEs with affordable, cutting-edge technology that boosts operational efficiency. InnovateX has created AI tools that cater to niche SME requirements, providing a competitive edge. Its competitive pricing compared to established players, making it attractive to budget-conscious SMEs. A lean and highly skilled workforce enables rapid development and deployment of solutions. It also offers personalized customer service that helps retain clients and build loyalty. A strong network of early adopters provides consistent feedback for product improvement. Despite all good points, InnovateX lacks strong brand visibility in a crowded market. Limited funding is restricting large-scale marketing and expansion efforts of InnovateX. Heavy reliance on a small group of experts makes the company vulnerable to turnover. Existing infrastructure is insufficient to support a sudden surge in customer base. Its operations are only in India, missing out on global opportunities. There is increasing demand for affordable tech solutions among SMEs in developing countries across the globe. There is governmental support for digital transformation in India offering funding and partnership opportunities. Collaborations with financial institutions and NGOs can help to bundle products with SME financing schemes. InnovateX can target underpenetrated markets in Southeast Asia and Africa and also expand into  areas such as AI-driven HR tools or customer relationship management software. InnovateX is facing intense competition from both global giants and local startups which are aggressively targeting the SME tech market. Fluctuations in the Indian economy could affect SME spending power affecting the growth of the company. Rapid advancements in AI can make InnovateX’s current offerings outdated. Rising data protection standards and potential breaches are a matter of concern because it has potential to could harm the company’s reputation. Compliance with evolving tech and data regulations may increase operational complexities for InnovateX.

Create a SWOT quadrant of InnovateX with minimum five points in each quadrant.

[01/03/25, 6:24:26 PM] ~ Charu: *Our reel on mech is out🚨...make sure you are doing the following things*
1) Sharing the reel on your story
2) liking the reel
3) commenting..(unique comments will be counted)
4) Save the reel and also do tag your mechanical friends in comments and share the reel as much as possible.

These simple things will help alot to increase the reach of our reel and I encourage everyone to do this cause this is a very easy and the simplest way to earn some extra points
